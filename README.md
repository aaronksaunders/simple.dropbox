Not much else to say...

Was trying to implement dropbox functionality in plain javascript and not used the Appcelerator module, so I just started coding. I will be adding more functionality as I have time, but for now it just uploads files

Also please not the javascript file is minified because it is a work in progress, when completed and I have time to support it I will release the full source code.

So... why am I postng it at all you might ask? Because some requested just this functionality so I figured I would try and help out
